                    <p>I'm an ESL teacher currently looking to become a web developer. I've dabbled with scripting for
                        a computer game in the past, so I know that I enjoy both the creativity and the logic that goes
                        into coding, as well as the "eureka" moments that come when I figure out how to perform
                        a particularly daunting task.</p>
                    </br>


                    <p>Despite that, however, I'd still very much characterize myself as a beginner, both because
                        the only coding I've done has been relatively basic, and because it's been more than a year now
                        since I've worked on scripts for the aforementioned game. Still, the memory of that experience
                        and the prospect of a career change have me very excited to learn how to code.</p>
